                product, and I want to collaborate. I want to be molded into a pro,
                and I want be better tomorrow than I am today. It's what I've loved
                about my "unemployed" summer, and it seems like TRBL could be a great fit!</p>

                <p className="details__body">I was tasked with making a React based scheduling
                system, but it had to be hosted on Google App Scripts and use a Google Sheet as a
                database. It's not the way I would choose to build it, but to make it HIPAA compliant
                it had to be done that way. While it works, and looks good, the performance is slow
                because of Sheets and App Script. I'm excited to fix that once they get a relational
                database set up.</p>
